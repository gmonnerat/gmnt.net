Checking the post <a rel="in-reply-to" href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/07/30/hugo-on-netlify-insanely-fast-deploys">Hosting Hugo on Netlify - Insanely Fast Deploys</a>, I tried to host my blog on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

It was really fast to deploy. Just some clicks and I got the instance.

Create an account was slower than deploy :).

I really enjoyed.
