Long time ago, I tried to host my blog on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and I was quite happy that in few clicks, I deployed my simple blog there.

This week, I tried to upgrade my own server and I realized that this server is a mess. A lot of applications not working, useless patches, etc.

So, let's drop the server :)

To move the blog, I created an instance in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), linked it to the [github repository](https://github.com/gmonnerat/gmonnerat.github.com/) and updated the DNS record for my domain. 

Done. Blog is live!

The next step is drop my mail server.
