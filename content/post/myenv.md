Since 2012, I switched from a Thinkpad laptop to Chromebook, to force me to write, use and understand more Web applications.

At home, I have Samsung Chromebook, that is slow when you are doing a lot things, and to work I&#39;m using [Lenovo N20p Chromebook](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/n-series/n20p/) that is quite good and enough for me.

In both laptops I use [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) with [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) that I develop locally when required and connect to my development environment through SSH.

In case of run a Linux software, as [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), I use [i3](http://i3wm.org/).
