One week without internet at home and I thought that this would be impossible
and boring, but in one week I read more than my last 3 months.

I finished [A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18635622-a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms). Really good.

And I started [Thinking fast and slow](http://www.amazon.fr/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B005MJFA2W/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1433545661) and [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](http://www.amazon.fr/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master-ebook/dp/B003GCTQAE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1433546102&sr=1-1&keywords=the+pragmatic+programmer). Both are good until now.
