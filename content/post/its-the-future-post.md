Very interesting [post/satire](http://blog.circleci.com/its-the-future/) that makes
me think how difficult is build simple applications nowadays.

We have a lot of good applications and tools, but to start something, maybe we don&#39;t need.

Is a very good exercise for me try to create a simple application instead of build huge applications just for me.
