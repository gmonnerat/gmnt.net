Since 3rd September, I am working full time in my projects and companies. And since that time, I changed a lot the tools and technologies I use.

First, I split my time between:

[marcelamonnerat.com.br](https://marcelamonnerat.com.br/) - a bit of accounting

[mariaaugustina.com.br](https://www.mariaaugustina.com.br/) - logistics and e-commerce

[sanploy.com.br](https://www.sanploy.com.br/) under [quiploy.com](http://quiploy.com/) - developing custom applications

This websites are hosted in [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) and source code stored in [Github](https://github.com/). I love this combination because every commit in the repository triggers one deploy in [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) automatically.

To handle my documents, I am using [google docs](https://docs.google.com) and [evernote](https://evernote.com).

To handle my tasks and projects, I am using [Asana](https://asana.com/) and I am enjoying a lot. It is very simple and easy to use.

To handle my emails, [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com). Nothing to say, just amazing!!

For my customers, I am using:

*   [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as frontend;

*   Nginx with push stream under [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) for [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events);

*   [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/);

*   [Redis](https://redis.io/) for async tasks;

*   [Memcached](https://www.memcached.org/) for caching;

*   Python, Django and JavaScript;

What is hardest part? Keep things simple :)
